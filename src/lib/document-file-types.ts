/**
 * The file types the document uploaders offer in the OS file picker.
 *
 * Scope note (rovno #284, slice S6). `accept` is a picker filter, never a
 * validation gate: the backend and RLS remain the only real gates, and
 * `prepare_document_upload` accepts an arbitrary mime string regardless.
 *
 * But do NOT read that as "harmless, so keep it tight". On DESKTOP the user can
 * escape it via the picker's "All Files" option; on iOS and Android the Files
 * picker ENFORCES it with no such escape, so anything missing here is a format
 * a phone user simply cannot attach. An earlier revision of this comment claimed
 * the list was merely a hint and was wrong on exactly that point.
 *
 * So the list is deliberately GENEROUS, and covers what the product handles end
 * to end (store, version, hand back) rather than what it can preview inline.
 * Only `image/*` and `application/pdf` render in the preview dialog today - slice
 * S4 tracks the rest - but a .pptx or .dwg uploads and downloads correctly, and
 * refusing it at the picker would remove a working capability to paper over a
 * missing one. When in doubt, add the extension: the cost of a wrong inclusion
 * is a file nobody previews, and the cost of a wrong exclusion is a user on a
 * phone who cannot attach their document at all.
 *
 * HEIC/HEIF are spelled out explicitly because `image/*` alone does not match
 * them in some Android browsers. `ProjectGallery.tsx` already does the same.
